**In this project, we actually see the speed and algorithm difference of different sorting techniques.**
### Basic Outlet of the Code:-
1. The vertical bars from the top represents different array elements.
2. "Array Size" bar is to change the size of the array accordingly.
3. "Algorithm Speed" bar is to vary the speed of the algorithm by certain factor according to the ease of an individual's capacity to notice different stages.
4. "Generate New" button is to generate new array condition on which code could be re-run.
5. "Bubble", "Selection", "Insertion", "Merge", "Quick" and "Heap" buttons are different sorting algorithms.
6. Buttons become non-functional once an algorithm starts executing and becomes active again when the execution is complete.
